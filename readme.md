This repository contains the implementation of a **K-pop Artist Management System** developed in **Python** using **PyQt5** for the graphical user interface. This project is my final assignment for the **Logic and Programming Design** course, focusing on the application of **data structures, control logic, and GUI design**.

## 📖 Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to manage the information of artists in a K-pop agency. Users can add, search, update, and delete artists, allowing for efficient data management. The system utilizes a list of artists, facilitating the filtering and presentation of information in an organized manner. This project serves as a practical application of programming concepts learned in class and as a tool for effectively managing artist data.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.10**: For implementing the core logic and functionality of the management system.
- **PyQt5**: For creating an intuitive and interactive graphical user interface.

## ✨ Features
- **Artist Management**: Users can easily add, search, update, and delete artist records.
- **Interactive GUI**: The project includes a user-friendly interface built with PyQt5, making it easy to enter and view data.
- **Use of Data Structures and Control Logic**: The system demonstrates effective use of Python's data structures (e.g., lists and dictionaries) and control structures to manage artist information.
